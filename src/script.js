// This file is for testing background scripts. if this works we will be able
// to know how persist the clock timer functions. the logic may need to be reworked.


// make a chrome alarm that alerts 1min after you press the start button
// next make sure that if you hit the stop button it logs how long you had
// to go before the alarm goes off. when you hit start it'll take that time
// as the amount of time before the alert. the reset button should clear all
// alarms and allow you to hit start again as a new alarm cycle.

// make a background html and js that are always running. this should allow the timer to persist.
// work on page to page communication
